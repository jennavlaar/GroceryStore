# GroceryStore

A web-based grocery store would provide the basic needs for those who do not have access to a grocery store. Those who cannot easily walk or drive to a grocery store and those who are immunocompromised would have access to groceries if an online grocery store was available to them. Groceries would be selected online then delivered to the customerâ€™s door so that they would not have to leave their home.
